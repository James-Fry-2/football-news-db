## CURSOR WORKFLOW STRATEGY

### Daily Development Pattern:
1. **Morning Planning** (15 mins): Review progress, plan today's tasks
2. **Development Sessions** (2-3 hours): Use specific Cursor prompts
3. **Testing & Iteration** (30 mins): Test features, fix issues
4. **End-of-day Review** (15 mins): Document progress, plan tomorrow

### Key Cursor Commands:
- **`Ctrl+K`**: Generate specific components/functions
- **`Ctrl+L`**: Debug and explain issues
- **`@filename`**: Reference specific files in prompts
- **Chat**: Architecture planning and explanations

## BUDGET & COST TRACKING

### Monthly Operating Costs:
- **OpenAI API**: $100-200 (main cost)
- **Pinecone**: $70 (vector database)
- **Hosting**: $50-100 (additional services)
- **External APIs**: $50-100 (football data)
- **Total**: $270-470/month

### Cost Optimization:
- Aggressive LLM response caching (70% cost reduction)
- Smart rate limiting (50 queries/day free tier)
- Efficient prompt engineering
- Background processing to avoid timeouts

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### High-Risk Items:
1. **LLM API Costs** â†’ Implement caching + rate limiting
2. **External API Changes** â†’ Build adapter pattern + fallbacks  
3. **Performance Issues** â†’ Load testing + optimization
4. **Scope Creep** â†’ Stick to MVP, iterate later

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Daily cost monitoring dashboard
- Multiple API provider fallbacks
- Progressive feature rollout
- Regular performance benchmarking
